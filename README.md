# simple-blog
Simple blog with ejs and express

Challenge project from "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu/The App Brewery.

To setup the database, download and setup MongoDB Community (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) locally and create a database called wikiDB.

Clone the repo, initialize NPM in the app directory, NPM install express, body-parser, ejs, and mongoose, and use 'node app.js' to run locally on localhost:3000.

You can add new blog posts at localhost:3000/compose

Below is a demo showing how to add and access a longer blog post.
